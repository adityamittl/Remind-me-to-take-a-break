# Remind me to take a break

## 💡 Inspiration

Do you feel annoyed pausing the video again while you don't look at your screen? Well, this is the solution for you. Remind me to take a break is a platform where the video you are watching is paused whenever you are not facing the screen. Your face is tracked and if you are not facing toward the screen, the video is paused.

## 💻 What it does

Remind me to take a break is a platform where the video you are watching is paused whenever you are not facing the screen. Your face is tracked and if you are not facing toward the screen, the video is paused. The video is automatically resumed when you are facing toward the screen. The video is paused after 1 hr so that you can take a break and move around.
